# hello-world
in which a new repository is conceived and created
I am the master of this tiny, branched off world, and I shall, without pulling punches, change as much and as often, as I can.
I know fortran and python and little bit of C and C++. I can hack HTML code apart or together, whichever suits my needs at the time.
